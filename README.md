# OBJECT DETECTION USING YOLO
üéØ Objective:
To develop a system capable of detecting and classifying multiple objects in real-time using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning algorithm.

üß† Technology Stack:
Model: YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv7, or YOLOv8 (depending on your project goals)

‚öôÔ∏è Key Components:
1. Data Preprocessing:

    Image resizing and normalization

    Augmentation (rotation, flipping, color jitter, etc.)

    Label conversion to YOLO format

2.Model Training:

    Select a YOLO version (YOLOv5 is widely used and user-friendly)
  
     Configure model (number of classes, input size, epochs, etc.)
     
     Train on custom or public dataset

3.Model Evaluation:

     Metrics: mAP (mean Average Precision), Precision, Recall

      Visual validation on test set

4.Real-Time Inference:

    Capture frames using OpenCV

    Pass each frame to the YOLO model

    Draw bounding boxes and labels

5.Deployment:

    Web Interface (Flask or Streamlit)

    Edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, etc.)

    Mobile app (via TensorFlow Lite or ONNX)
